- 👋 Hi, I’m @RayJurado
- 👀 Use talents in technology, organization, and business acumen to elevate the decisions and the work of others.  I use what I like to do and what I am good at to create results that matter to others.  Each of my jobs since 2012, I’ve pursued asking that question.
- 🌱 I’m currently using T-SQL, SSIS, and minor scripting as a data warehouse engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the pandas library and how to better manipulate data frames in Python to support analysis work where that applies.
- I'm making time this year to do personal projects for my own utilization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on utilities and write documentation to make some part of life easier
- 📫 How to reach me ...
